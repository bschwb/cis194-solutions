# CIS 194 - Spring 2013 - Solutions

To learn Haskell I work through [CIS 194 - Spring
2013](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) by
Brent Yorgey, as recommended in https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell.

The author of the second link provides good reasons why he recommends this
course here: http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2014-12-31-functional-education.html

Although I think they are for the course of 2014 or something, I sometimes take
a look at this solutions as the assignments are often the same / similar.

Feel free to add a PR or contact me for any improvements etc.

For convenience I included the files for the homework assignments provided by
the course. I did **NOT** create them.

Also the ```lecture-test.hs``` include some codelines used in the lectures of
the course for testing.
